# Project 01 Requirements

The group project must meet the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap along side any custom CSS. You're free to use any other CSS Framework besides Bootstrap 4 including Bootstrap v5!

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two server-side APIs. A good resource for public APIs can be found at this [Github repo](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

  > NOTE: Avoid APIs that require use of OAuth for Authentication. Some APIs require both an API Key **and** OAuth so make sure your go through the documentation covering how to use and make API calls carefully before commiting to using the API.

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

> **Note**: More details about the project are provided in the online lessons for Module 7.
